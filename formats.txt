Object file:
------------
Object files are used as output from the assembler or compilers.  It is an
intermediate format that needs to be linked to produce an actual executable.
The object file is divided into records, defined below:

  Stat Record:
  ------------
  Byte     Meaning
  0        Record type.  =0 to indicate a stat record
  1..2     Minimum load address for enclosed code/data blocks
  3..4     Maximum load address for enclosed code/data blocks
  5..6     Minimum allowed address for relocatable blocks
  7..8     Maximum allowed address for relocatable blocks

  Code Record:
  ------------
  Size     Meaning
  1        Record type.  =1 to indicate a code record
  2        Size of record, including record header
  2        Load address of record (65535=relocatable data record)
  2        Size of symbol table
  nSt      Symbol table for block
  2        Size of external dependency table
  nEdt     External dependency table
  2        Size of relocatable page table
  nRpt     Relocatable page table
  2        Size of code block
  rCb      Code bytes

  Data Record:
  ------------
  Byte   Meaning
  0      Record type.  =2 to indicate a data record
  1..2   Size of record, including record header
  3..4   Load address of record (65535=relocatable data record)
  5..n   Data bytes

  Execution Record:
  -----------------
  Byte   Meaning
  0      Record type.  = 3 to indicate execution record
  1..2   Sizeo of record, including header (5)
  3..4   Execution address

  Misc Record:
  ------------
  Byte   Meaning
  0      Record type.  =254 to indicate misc record
  1..2   Size of record, including record header
  3..n   Data bytes


  Termination Record:
  -------------------
  Byte   Meaning
  0      Record type.  =255 to indicate termination record

  Symbol Table:
  -------------
  asciiz of symbol name (0 if no more entries)
  2 bytes inidicating offset in code block of symbol

  External Dependency Table:
  --------------------------
  asciiz of external name (0 if no more entries)
  2 bytes inidicating offset in code block of symbol reference

  Relocatable page table:
  -----------------------
  Each entry is 2 bytes which is the offset to the page entry that needs
  to be changed

Library File:
-------------
Library files contain collections of object files that can be used by the
linker.  The library file is divided into records:

  Version Record:
  ---------------
  Byte      Meaning
  0         Record type.  =0 to indicate version record
  1         Major version number
  2         Minor version number
  3         Patch level
  4         Month
  5         Day
  6..7      Year
  
  Object Record:
  --------------
  Byte      Meaning
  0         Record type.  = 1 to indicate an object record
  1..2      Size of object name
  3..n      Object name (asciiz)
  n+1..n+2  Size of oject
  n+3..n+n  Object data (same format as object file)

  Misc Record:
  ------------
  Byte      Meaning
  0         Record type.  =254 to inidcate misc record
  1..2      Size of record, including record header
  3..n      Data bytes

  Termination Record:
  -------------------
  Byte      Meaning
  0         Record type.  =255 to indicate termination record
